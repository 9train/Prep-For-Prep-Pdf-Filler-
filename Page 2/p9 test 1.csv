Arianna enjoys mathematics and it shows in the quality of her work.  Her problem solving on the first problem set of the year was exemplary.  At the beginning of the term, she was diligent about submitting her homework.  However, over the last week she has not turned in several geometry assignments and it is negatively impacting her grade.  I encourage her to continue to keep on top of her work even as the workload increases.

This resulted in disrespect that was disruptive to learning. However, as I have corrected him and reminded him to raise his hand over the past few weeks, he has shown a lot of improvement. His work is high quality, and he is clearly putting in effort to showcase how bright he is. I think what is important for Lucas is to continue to find ways of managing his attention and energy. He never seems to be intentionally disruptive, so I think learning tools to help him focus on one thing at a time, or manage his distractions creatively will be really helpful.

She is a good writer, and I would like to see her give more thought to the smoothness and structure of her writing stye.  She can also ask questions to ensure that she understands instructions, and she can use the text to proofread capitalization and spelling in her writing. "

Interim Grade: B-

This class focuses on Euclidean geometry with an emphasis on justifying answers by invoking specific properties, postulates, and theorems. Abigail performs consistently well on quizzes, tests, and homework. But there is still quite a bit of room for her to improve. She can do so by asking for clarification in class and during office hours."

She started her time in this program very strong, and continues to perform well. It is clear she puts a lot of time in to each of her assignments. However, on the flip side, when she doesn't have that kind of time to give, her performance falls. Her more recent assignments were almost shocking to me, as they were so unlike her usual high scoring work. I would love to see Abigail find a middle ground. How can she complete assignments well, without requiring multiple hours for her work? Can she showcase what she knows in a more efficient way, that at least brings her more consistency, rather than receiving perfect scores and failing grades?"

To help improve his overall grade, I suggest providing additional support to classmates during discussion and spending more time with the text to increase thorough annotations, which will then increase his quiz scores.

Emphasis is placed on the effects of geography on social development, cultural values, and connections to today.  In addition to the History content, heavy attention is paid to writing skills, specifically the structure and execution of paragraphs and essays.  Students also develop critical thinking skills and enhance their social abilities through cooperative partner and small group work, particularly in historical debates.  A centerpiece of the work at Hotchkiss is a research project in which students utilize the school’s extensive library resources to explore a topic of their choice.
       Abdoul is an eager and engaged student of History.  Although he can be impulsive, he always participates meaningfully in class discussions.  He is a solid writer, and I encourage him to vary his word choice to more colorfully express his good ideas.  He works well with partners, and he gave a good account of himself in our recent debate.  I want Abdoul to take a serious look at his homework production.  I predict that more complete and correct nightly work will enhance his learning and his grade average."

He participates frequently, and stands out to me in that regard. However, as time has gone on, I have been surprised by his homework and assignments. He has a much lower grade than I would have envisioned for him from his disposition and presence in the classroom. I think it will be critical for Abdoul to build organizational systems to support him as he moves forward. For example, most days when he leaves the room, there is one of his papers left behind. This simple moment feels reflective to me of what Abdoul can target most in his time here: staying organized to let his brilliance shine. "
